## Jules

What do these things have in common ?
- Drumbeats 
- Picking patterns for stringed instruments
- Bowing patterns for bowed instruments

 Much like in a Guitar Hero song as it goes from Beginner to Expert, Jules lets you add 'layers' to the music you are composing. 

For now Jules is focused on drumbeats as those are what I know best. But as I also play a stringed instrument, I intend for those to be just as supported in due time.

Jules can be a creative tool, or a learning tool, ideally both at once.

Examples are drumbeats. In Jules' world, you may layer up a drum beat by:

- starting with a steady right foot bassdrum beat
- moving every other of those to the hi-hat on left foot
- adding a left hand snare in sync with the hihat
- adding a right hand ride at double the original speed


which would yield something like

    x x x x x x x x
        <       <
    o       o   

equivalently, you might think of this beat as:

- starting with a steady 1/8 note right hand pattern
- adding a left hand pattern in a 1:4 ratio to the right hand, shifted by 2/4 
- adding a right foot pattern in a 1:2 ratio to the right hand

Jules terminology
- Sequence: Aka seqs (pronounced SEEKs) this is what Jules exists to make for you. Each element of a seq is one or more simultaneous events, each having one or more properties, or no properties if it is a rest.

- Events: These are musical notes or rests, but are not limited to containing note, volume information, they may and should include which limb or finger they are played with, whether accented or not, etc..

- Generators: These produce a seq

- Effers: These 'f' (aka filter/effect) with an input seq and produce an output seq. Some of them affect the timing of the seq, others just 'eff' with the qualities of events, possibly muting them
